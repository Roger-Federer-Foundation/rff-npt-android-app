<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>When children play in the early years of their lives, they are developing skills, habits, and attitudes that become the foundation for their schooling and adult work life, and that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Play is so important for the development of a child that it has been identified by the United Nations<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as a right of every child.</p>
<p>The skills required to properly develop self-discipline, motivation, and the ability to collaborate, all start to take root in the first six years of life. Through play, children learn how to cope with frustration, how to keep trying until they get it right, how to share with others, and how to express themselves. In addition, the foundations for reading, writing and maths are laid down during play, ensuring that children are ready for school.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-natural-playgrounds-toolkit">What is the Natural Playgrounds Toolkit?</h3>
<p>In many places, children lack stimulating play opportunities. The Natural Playgrounds Toolkit was developed by <a href="https://penreach.co.za/">Penreach</a> to raise awareness of the importance of play and to empower communities, grade R teachers and early childhood practitioners, by providing them with the skills required to build a playground for young children out of natural resources.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h3>
<dl class="definition">
<dt class="definition-term">Stakeholders (Partners)</dt><dd class="definition-description">People who have an interest in realising the project in favour of the children.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Natural Playgrounds Toolkit is a manual designed for you as a grade R teacher, early childhood development practitioner, community development worker, or for any other interested <strong data-term="Stakeholders (Partners)">stakeholders</strong> to study individually or as a group. It is meant for you to study individually or to use for your discussions as a group, and provides you with the guidance and tools required to build a natural playground.</p>
<h3 id="how-was-it-developed">How was it developed?</h3>
<p>Penreach, with the support of the <a href="https://www.rogerfedererfoundation.org/en/home/">Roger Federer Foundation</a>, piloted the natural playgrounds initiative in several locations in Mpumalanga, South Africa, with local communities and schools. Another Roger Federer Foundation partner, Molteno, also drew lessons from the Penreach natural playgrounds initiatives and has also replicated natural playgrounds in several schools and communities in Limpopo Province in South Africa. Through this practical experience and lessons learnt during these pilots, this natural playground manual was then developed. So, what you are learning here has been successfully applied in practice!</p>
<h3 id="how-should-it-be-used">How should it be used?</h3>
<dl class="definition">
<dt class="definition-term">Natural Playground</dt><dd class="definition-description">An area where kids can play with natural elements such as sand, water, wood, and living plants.</dd><dt class="definition-term">Resources</dt><dd class="definition-description">A supply of money, materials, staff, volunteers, and other assets that can be used by the project to effectively achieve its aims.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The toolkit is divided into five sections that represent the different steps to be followed in establishing a <strong data-term="Natural Playground">natural playground</strong>. In the toolkit, you will find a toolbox of practical tools and samples that will help you consider everything necessary to make a success of your project. The toolkit will guide you step by step through the whole process of establishing a natural playground in collaboration with parents and your local community.</p>
<p>While you work through the toolkit, you are encouraged to keep a journal or a set of notes that can help you reflect on your journey and also to note down discussion points for your learning group. At first glance, some of the tools may seem to contain similar information, but they are all actually important in their own right and build on each other. Each tool, therefore, forms a specific part of the process that enables you to get to the end result. There is no hard and fast rule that you must use all the tools, or use them all exactly as they are presented – adapt and be creative as you see fit. If you are an experienced community development worker, some of the tools may seem so obvious that you could feel tempted to skip them. We do strongly suggest that you consider the pros and cons carefully before discarding a tool. Remember, however, that our goal is to leverage the experience, expertise and <strong data-term="Resources">resources</strong> that you and your community members and <strong data-term="Stakeholders (Partners)">stakeholders</strong> bring to the table collectively, and to help you all successfully build your children the best natural playground with as many natural resources and as little financial cost to you as a school or community as possible.</p>
